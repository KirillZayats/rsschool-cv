# Hi everyone, I'm Kiryl Zayats (@KirillZayats)! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm **Front-end developer** from Belarus. By profession Software Engineer. My experience in project development is two years. Thanks to my specialty and work, I understand perfectly how to organize the software development process. I have good knowledge and skills in Front-end and Back-end development. At work I independently managed Full-stack projects.

**Why did I choose Front-end development?**
I like the process of developing functionality and website layout. I am a visual person and it gives me great pleasure when before my eyes there is a transformation from emptiness to a fully functioning website or Web application.

In the near future I plan to take courses to learn English and learn new technologies in Front-end.
